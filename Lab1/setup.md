## Setup

### Prerequisites
None
### Setting up your computer

The *getting started* guide on Docker has detailed instructions for setting up Docker on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).

*If you're using Docker for Windows* make sure you have [shared your drive](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#shared-drives).

*Important note* If you're using an older version of Windows or MacOS you may need to use [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/) instead.

*All commands work in either bash or Powershell on Windows*

Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:
```
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
03f4658f8b78: Pull complete

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
