## 5.0 Docker Compose
**The goal of this exercise is to create a Docker Compose with Python/Flask application with Redis database**

Project structure:
```
.
├── app.py
├── flask
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt



```

### 5.1 Create a Python Flask app


Start by creating a directory called ```mkdir composetest``` where we'll create the following files:

Make sure to ```cd composetest``` before you start creating the files.

### 5.2 app.py

Create the **app.py** with the following content:

```python
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

#### 5.3 requirements.txt

In order to install the Python modules required for our app, we need to create a file called **requirements.txt** and add the following line to that file:

```
flask
redis
```


### 5.4 Write a Dockerfile

```
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

### 5.7 docker-compose.yaml
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

The compose file defines an application with three services `web` and `redis` backend.

## 5.8 Deploy with docker-compose

```
$ docker-compose up -d

```

## 5.9 Expected result

Listing containers must show two containers running and the port mapping


After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser or run:
```
$ curl http://localhost:5000
Hello World! I have been seen 1 times.
```

Refresh the page.

The number should increment.


Stop and remove the containers
```
$ docker-compose down
```
